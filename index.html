      the Indian Ocean in the State of Tamil Nadu and located at the Southern
      Most tip of the Indian Subcontinent. Many call it KOODAL meaning it is
      situated at the Confluence of three oceans Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and
      Indian Ocean. Kanyakumari is popular because it is the only places on

      spectacular on Chitra Paurnami [full moon that occurs in Apr-May] when one

      a rare sight of unique grandeur, which seems to happen by prior
      arrangement. Citys population is 22,453 [2011 census] and the District
